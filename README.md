## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project was submitted as part of the CSC345: Big Data and Machine Learning module and received a grade of **84%**.

The objective was to investigate and compare the performance of two deep learning modelsâ€” a fully connected neural network (NN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN)â€”on the CIFAR-100 dataset, using both fine-grained (100-class) and coarse-grained (20-class) classification labels.

## ðŸ”¬ Methodology

Two models were developed and evaluated:

### 1. Fully Connected Neural Network (NN)
- Input: Flattened 32Ã—32Ã—3 images
- Architecture: Two dense layers (256 â†’ 128), ReLU activation, HeNormal initialisation
- Regularisation: Dropout (0.3)
- Optimiser: Adam
- Output: Softmax over 100/20 classes

### 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Two convolutional blocks with 64 and 128 filters
- ReLU activations, max pooling, dropout (0.5)
- Dense layer for final classification
- Optimised with Adam and early stopping

Both models were trained for up to 20 epochs and evaluated on classification accuracy.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

| Task            | Benchmark | Fully Connected NN | CNN          |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------|
| Fine-Grained    | 24.49%    | 21.6%              | **32.9%**    |
| Coarse-Grained  | 39.43%    | 33.7%              | **47.3%**    |

- The CNN significantly outperformed the NN on both tasks.
- Better performance was observed in coarse-grained classification for both models.

> These results reinforce the effectiveness of CNNs in visual tasks and highlight the limits of basic dense architectures in complex datasets like CIFAR-100.
